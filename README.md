## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Personal game project trying to blend Slingshot RPG gameplay with Plants vs Zombies theme and quirkiness. Added on top are Card summoning system inspired by Monster Train & Gacha games. Plus the strategic layer of roguelike game. Quite a mouthful there, I know.

Probably (~~certainly~~) suffering from overscope, but learning is learning.

Note: Due to licensing, no assets are committed. This is purely code-side that I made, while there are other implementations on Engine/Game C++ side as well to make it works.
