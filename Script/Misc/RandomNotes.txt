SAY IT'S
CAROL SINGERS

WITH ANY LUCK,
BY NEXT YEAR

I’LL BE CHASING
SOME OF THESE BRAINS

BUT FOR NOW
LET ME SAY,

WITHOUT A BRAIN
OR A SHOWER,

JUST BECAUSE
IT’S HALLOWEEN-

(AND AT HALLOWEEN
YOU TELL THE "TRUTH")

TO ME, YOU ARE
PERFECT...

LY DELICIOUS

AND
MY ROTTEN HEART
WILL LOVE YOU

UNTIL YOU
LOOK LIKE THIS…

HAPPY
HALLOWEEN
